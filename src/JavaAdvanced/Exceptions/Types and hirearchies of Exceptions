At the top of the exception hierarchy in Java, we have the throwable class which defines all common characteristics for
all exceptions and errors. The Exception and Errors class derive from the Throwable class, and the runtime exception
class derives from the Exception class.

                                         ---> Throwable <---
                                        |    (checked)     |
                                        |                  |
                                        |                  |
                                ---> Exception           Error
                                |    (checked)        (unchecked)
                                |
                          RuntimeException
                            (unchecked)
